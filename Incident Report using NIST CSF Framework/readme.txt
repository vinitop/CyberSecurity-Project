This project centers on investigating a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack incident that occurred within a multimedia company. Its core objective is to leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to craft an incident report and devise an effective strategy for fortifying network security. By applying the five core functions of the CSF - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover - the project aims to pinpoint potential risks, implement safeguarding measures, bolster monitoring capabilities, respond to incidents swiftly, and restore any affected systems. The overarching aim is to bolster the company's security stance and reduce the possibility of future vulnerabilities, ensuring a resilient and secure network environment.

Within this project, cybersecurity experts will regularly perform audits to pinpoint security weaknesses within internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges. By enacting policies, procedures, training programs, and employing relevant tools, internal assets will be shielded from potential cyber threats. The project will also place significant emphasis on enhancing detection capabilities, enabling rapid identification of potential security breaches. A comprehensive incident response plan will be devised to contain and mitigate security incidents, along with a thorough analysis of their impact on the network. Finally, measures will be put in place to restore any affected systems, thus returning operations to normal while preserving data and assets. By adhering to the NIST CSF and taking a proactive stance, this project will make significant contributions towards improving network security and resilience within the multimedia company.
