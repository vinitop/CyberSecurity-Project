This project centers on the analysis of a security incident involving a travel agency's website. The incident revolves around the identification of a service disruption and the subsequent investigative process aimed at uncovering its root cause. The security analyst receives an automated alert that signals a problem with the web server. Upon closer examination, they discover an unusually high volume of TCP SYN requests originating from an unfamiliar IP address. The analyst concludes that the web server is currently under a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, leading to connection timeout errors for users attempting to access the website. To counter the attack, the analyst temporarily takes the server offline and enforces a firewall rule to block the offending IP address. However, they also acknowledge the necessity of additional measures to address the ongoing threat and preempt future incidents.

The project's objectives encompass identifying the specific nature of the attack, elucidating its impact on both the web server and the organization's employees, and formulating strategies to thwart the attacker while fortifying network security measures. By delving into the intricacies of network attacks and their repercussions, this endeavor serves as a valuable resource for troubleshooting network issues and implementing robust countermeasures to protect the integrity of the organization's network infrastructure.
